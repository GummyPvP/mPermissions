# mPermissions

Plugin that manages permissions and implements them into GummyPvP.

NOTE: This is pretty old code, and it's not used on our server anymore. If you plan on using this, please note that it's by no means a great permissions plugin, and you should make changes before putting it on a live server. This was just our first attempt at making this kind of thing. This plugin is free for anyone to use and make changes to (as long as you're not making money off of it, this plugin is licensed under GPL, so don't do that!)
